# Personal Blog

## An application to write and manage your personal blog or diary

The purpose of this application is to give users a simple interface for 
writing and organizing their private thoughts without needing to store them remotely
or share them with the world. The application will allow users to write entries
formatted using Markdown syntax. They will also be able to categorize the posts, 
tag them with various topics, and search through them based on their titles, tags
or content.
